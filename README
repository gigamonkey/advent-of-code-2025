# Advent of code

In this project we'll start using packages. When you run make for the first time
it will create a first .java file with a proper package declaration in the
proper directory. Thereafter you can make other classes in that same directory
with the same package declaration. In addition to being good practice, this will
let you use static imports from your own classes.

If you want you can use the Makefile to build the project in the terminal with
the `make` command. First you'll need to set the MAIN_CLASS variable in the
Makefile to the name of your main class.
